Simple PCB to allow an MBED NXP LPC1768 ARM development board
to be plugged into a Sanguinololu in place of the ATMEGA chip.  
It's single-sided to make for easy manufacture.  You will see
thet there are a few tracks on the back of the board - they all
run between vias, and so are intended to be replaced with wire 
jumpers.

The board routes the Sanguinololu 5V signal to the MBED's VIN
so the MBED USB is not needed to power it.

There is a micro-SD holder as well.

The MBED pinouts are:
