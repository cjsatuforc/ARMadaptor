Arduino DUE Sanguinololu Adaptor

Licence: GPL

Design: Adrian

Status: Pre-alpha - not yet made and tested.

Thanks to MAL's Adventures in Electronics Blog at 

http://circuitfun.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/arduino-mega-shield-template-in-eagle-improved/

for the Arduino sield blank design.

Simple PCBs to allow an Arduino DUE to be plugged into a Sanguinololu 
in place of its ATMEGA chip.  One is a shield for the Arduino that
has a pin header for a 20-way ribbon cable.  The other is a PCB that just
has a header for the other end of the ribbon connected to a set of pins that 
pretend to be the Sanguinololu's ATMEGA chip.  


The DUE pinouts are:

{X, Y, Z, [E]}
{Bed, Hot end}
-1 = not used

STEP_PINS {54, 60, 46, 26}
DIRECTION_PINS {55, 61, 48, 28}
ENABLE_PINS {38, -1, 62, -1}
STOP_PINS {3, 14, 17}
TEMP_SENSE_PINS {10, 9}  // Analogue pin numbers
HEAT_ON_PINS {8, 9}
