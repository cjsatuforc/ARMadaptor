Arduino DUE to Sanguinololu Adaptor

Licence: GPL

Design: Adrian

Status: Pre-alpha - not yet made and tested.

Thanks to MAL's Adventures in Electronics Blog at 

http://circuitfun.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/arduino-mega-shield-template-in-eagle-improved/

for the Arduino shield blank design.

Here are two simple PCBs to allow an Arduino DUE to be plugged into a Sanguinololu 
in place of its ATMEGA chip.  One is a shield for the Arduino that
has a pin header for a 20-way ribbon cable.  The other is a PCB that just
has a header for the other end of the ribbon connected to a set of pins that 
pretend to be the Sanguinololu's ATMEGA chip. 

The four Eagle files you want are:

due-adaptor.sch
due-adaptor.brd
due-adaptor-sanguinololu-end.sch
due-adaptor-sanguinololu-end.brd

The DUE pinouts are:

{X, Y, Z, [E]}
{Bed, Hot_end}
-1 = not used

STEP_PINS {54, 60, 46, 26}
DIRECTION_PINS {55, 61, 48, 28}
ENABLE_PINS {38, -1, 62, -1}
STOP_PINS {3, 14, 17}
TEMP_SENSE_PINS {10, 9}  // Analogue pin numbers
HEAT_ON_PINS {8, 9}

The pins are intended to be as compatible as possible with the RAMPS board, 
while allowing things like the Arduino Ethernet shield to work as well.
